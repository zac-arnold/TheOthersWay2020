      "bio": "One dark night, under the glow of a gas heater, Adam Hattaway and the Haunters emerged with a soul music anthology in one hand and a glass of red wine in the other. They’ll take you back to the good old days, circa. 1965, when a man could simply fall in love and cry about it. Based in Christchurch, Adam Hattaway and the Haunters have been building a national reputation as an electrifying live act. With sweltering hooks and starry-eyed narrative, their sound says ‘put your arm around the one you love and remember that they won’t be there forever – but maybe that’s a good thing.’ Adam Hattaway is for lovers. A born frontman, he performs alongside three Haunters; Elmore Jones, Liam Quinn, and Thomas Isbister. Their enigmatic live performances are often strengthened by emotive horn lines and organ from some of New Zealand’s filthiest players." ,

The Bats singer songwriter/guitarist, Robert Scott and bassist/producer Paul Kean both reside in the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame for their achievements, respectively with The Clean and Toy Love. Joined by Kaye Woodward on lead guitar/backing vocals and drummer Malcolm Grant, this combination produces a surprisingly wide range of material with songs from twisted wistful folk to psychedelic rock to bouncy twee pop. But whatever the song style, The Bats’ sound is always distinctively and unmistakably The Bats - the mark of a great band comfortable with who they.",

Dons and keyboard player Biddy Leyland had previously played in Auckland's stroppy girl band 'Freudian Slips'.Shortly after this they signed to Flying Nun after Chris Knox happened upon their song 'Barlow's house'. Following a local buzz around the band, they promptly relocated to London at the invitation of Billy Bragg who had heard them on the radio in Auckland while on a NZ tour. They played regularly in London and recorded a second EP and an album which were well received by the English music press. With Dead famous people members eventually pulling in different directions, Savage returned home to NZ and continued to write songs, settling in a central suburb to raise son Harry. In 2018 a chance meeting in a London club between a longtime DFP fan and Fire records boss James Nicholls, resulted in the signing of DFP to Fire records, after James requested and heard new demos. Their first offering via Fire is the aptly titled album 'Harry' due out on October 9th 2020.",

That’s the space that Earth Tongue occupy. At times, their songs are shrill and disorientating, other times their reverb-washed textures and instantly-familiar hooks can wrap you in a warm, loving embrace. The one consistent thread through their music, however, is the thick and all-encompassing fuzz. Guitarist Gussie Larkin (Mermaidens) has become a master of the fuzz-smothered riff, and along with Ezra Simons’ off-kilter drumming, they’ve been sending punters into transcendental states since they began gigging in their home town of Wellington in 2016. Following the release of their debut album Floating Being in 2019 via Bristol-based label Stolen Body Records, Earth Tongue toured Australia, the UK and Europe, picking up praise along the way from BBC Radio6, Bandcamp and headbangers all over the world." ,
