      "name": "ADAM HATTAWAY AND THE HAUNTERS",
      "bio": "One dark night, under the glow of a gas heater, Adam Hattaway and the Haunters emerged with a soul music anthology in one hand and a glass of red wine in the other. They’ll take you back to the good old days, circa. 1965, when a man could simply fall in love and cry about it. Based in Christchurch, Adam Hattaway and the Haunters have been building a national reputation as an electrifying live act. With sweltering hooks and starry-eyed narrative, their sound says ‘put your arm around the one you love and remember that they won’t be there forever – but maybe that’s a good thing.’ Adam Hattaway is for lovers. A born frontman, he performs alongside three Haunters; Elmore Jones, Liam Quinn, and Thomas Isbister. Their enigmatic live performances are often strengthened by emotive horn lines and organ from some of New Zealand’s filthiest players." ,

No split ups and reforming for nostalgia’s sake.They’ve clocked up 9 albums - each one evolving with new material from the prolific songwriting hand of Robert Scott. The Bats singer songwriter/guitarist, Robert Scott and bassist/producer Paul Kean both reside in the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame for their achievements, respectively with The Clean and Toy Love. Joined by Kaye Woodward on lead guitar/backing vocals and drummer Malcolm Grant, this combination produces a surprisingly wide range of material with songs from twisted wistful folk to psychedelic rock to bouncy twee pop. But whatever the song style, The Bats’ sound is always distinctively and unmistakably The Bats - the mark of a great band comfortable with who they.",

After heavy boardroom negotiations with Auckland’s favorite surf punks JANG, Cootie Cuties won shared custody of drummer Alex. The conditions of the agreement were that they wouldn’t feed him after midnight  for fear of him turning into a gremlin. Drawing from a range of influences from Madonna to Jawbreaker, Cootie Cuties give you something to shake your booty to. Juxtaposed with lyrics about Menstrual Freedom and addressing the issue of domestic violence leaving you with something to think about. ",

Channelling the classic Kiwi pub rock vibes of yesteryear alongside landlord-induced anxieties and a healthy interest in pinging, DARTZ have quickly gained recognition in Wellington for a top-tier first year that included the release of debut EP No Matter Whatz, sharing the stage with Aussie legends The Chats twice, playing a world record 14 Crate Day house parties in one day, and the luscious lyricism of “24 beers and 2 free hands” becoming just as iconic in the capital as rowdy Wednesday nights, Mittens and high-qual café nachos.",

Dons and keyboard player Biddy Leyland had previously played in Auckland's stroppy girl band 'Freudian Slips'.Shortly after this they signed to Flying Nun after Chris Knox happened upon their song 'Barlow's house'. Following a local buzz around the band, they promptly relocated to London at the invitation of Billy Bragg who had heard them on the radio in Auckland while on a NZ tour. They played regularly in London and recorded a second EP and an album which were well received by the English music press. With Dead famous people members eventually pulling in different directions, Savage returned home to NZ and continued to write songs, settling in a central suburb to raise son Harry. In 2018 a chance meeting in a London club between a longtime DFP fan and Fire records boss James Nicholls, resulted in the signing of DFP to Fire records, after James requested and heard new demos. Their first offering via Fire is the aptly titled album 'Harry' due out on October 9th 2020.",
